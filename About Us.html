            <h9>Introduction to RTO</h9>
            <p>RTO， Registering training institutions plays a crucial role in the vocational education and training (VET) industry. They offer a range of training courses aimed at helping individuals improve their skills, obtain qualifications, and ultimately succeed in the workplace.Recently, the "Registration Training Institution Standards" have been revised to better reflect the diversity of the VET industry and ensure that the standards are suitable for their purposes in different RTO settings. The revised standard provides a clearer and more direct connection between the expected requirements of RTO and the expected deliverables. This not only helps improve the quality of training, but also ensures that trainees can acquire practical and useful skills after receiving training.As part of the standard changes, some requirements have been repositioned in the draft compliance requirements and certificate strategy. This means that RTOs need to pay more attention to these new requirements in their operations to ensure that the training courses they provide meet the latest standards and expectations.It is worth noting that the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations is soliciting feedback on the draft certificate policy and compliance requirements. This is a valuable opportunity to involve industry experts, students, and other stakeholders in the process of standard development and improvement. By providing feedback, we can jointly promote the development of the VET industry, improve training quality, and provide high-quality training opportunities for more people.</p>
